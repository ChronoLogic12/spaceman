 # SPACEMAN - WEB BASED GAME

 ### Code Institute Milestone Project 2 HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT - Interactive Front-End Development

 ## About the game

 Spaceman is a space themed variant of the popular pen a paper game "Hangman". The aim of the game is to correctly identify a hidden word in order to board the rocket ship before it leaves without you. To do this the player must attempt to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. For each correct guess, instances of that letter are revealed to the player within the word, allowing them to better guess further letters. Incorrect guesses bring the ship closer to launch, whether they're on board or not.

  ## Testing

  ### User Testing
  During a short series of over the shoulder user testing of the game I discovered several areas which could be improved. These were - 
   * Young testers were sometimes having trouble with accidental highlighting of elements or right clicking. To remove this potential annoyance for the player I have disabled both highlighting and rick click actions.
   * During a short play test users were experiencing the same word on multiple rounds. The original count of words that could be randomly selected was approximately 40 which proved to be too few to provide enough variation. To counter this I have increased the count to over 100.
